It was exactly a year ago, when the coronavirus crept into Cambodia via a 60-year old man in Preah Sihanouk province who returned on a direct flight from Wuhan, 
China, on January 23 with three family members. Thinking it was just a normal flu with him running a fever and having a runny nose, 
he went to Preah Sihanouk Provincial Hospital on January 26 for some routine tests. 
Little did he know that on January 27 he would be identified as Cambodiaâ€™s first positive case of COVID-19.

On March 7, the second case was detected from a 38-year-old Cambodian taxi driver in Siem Reap province. 
He was among four people placed under quarantine at Siem Reap Provincial Referral Hospital whom all had come into direct contact with a 
Japanese man who had left Cambodia on February 3, and tested positive upon arrival in his country.
